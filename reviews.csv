0,SIMS Hospital,Chennai,Sims is centrally located at Vadapalani. Has a good reputation. They have emergency ward and ambulance service is also available. Yesterday I went there to visit someone and urgently needed to use the toilet. The toilet was locked. I asked the young boy at the reception what to do. To my pleasant surprise he came with me and guided me to a toilet inside the premises. Even that toilet was locked. Then he called an attender and told him to take me to a toilet that was unlocked and my problem was solved. What I actually expected was a brush off. The care this boy took was a pleasant change. But every rose has a thorn and the parking area attendants are exactly that. They seem to have employed all middle aged fat unwieldy parking attendants. They are lazy and disrespectful. I am sure the boss of the agency supplying the parking attendants must be exactly like them. That is why this attitude. No use blaming the attendants. Owners of the hospital must talk to the agency that supplies the parking attendants. Give me a like if my review was helpful guys... have a great day ,2.499999977648258

0,"Columbia Asia Hospital Salt Lake, Kolkata",Kolkata,Excellent service overall. Our patient (75 years) was admitted at a very very critical stage due to a fatal road accident but all the doctors nurses and the other medical staff did a superb job even in the middle of the night. Specially we received an overwhelming help within the scope of sheer professionalism by the receptionist(s) there at the night shift. I dont hesitate to take a special mention here Ms. Trisha Banerjee one of the customer care assistants there was just fabulous in helping us out. We had to keep bugging her over night for a lot of reasons since our patient was transferred from Emergency to finally Ventilation at ICU. She kept her cool and didnt held herself back from lending out a helping hand during the critical moments. Thanks and warm regards to everyone at Columbia Asia Salt Lake Kolkata.,3.799999974668026

0,Fortis Hospital,Kolkata,I had an appointment with one of the senior cardiologist. My appointment was at 1120 AM. I reached the place well in advance by 1045 AM to complete the formalities. Once all forms were filled along with payment it was informed that Doctor will be available by 1230 PM. It seems the usual norm is there is no fixed appointment schedule. If you want to meet your desired doctor then come in the morning wait till you are lucky. Next day was test which went well without any hassle. Third day was doctors consultation with the report. Again our appointment was at 345 PM. This time we came by 300 PM. but it seems we were too late. For a 345 PM appointment the expectation is to reach by 1230 PM. This was confirmed by the receptionist who had no idea when the doctor is going to arrive. Luckily I got my office laptop and finished half of my work sitting in the waiting area. The doc finally arrived by 600 PM. There was another instance where one patient who came for an appointment and was not informed that the doctor was on leave.

After reaching there the receptionist simply said the machines were all down it was rather shocking and unbelievable for such a big hospital to have machines not running and all down and the worst thing was they didnt even bother to call back and informed about there machines situation. Id have no issues if they would have call back at least as it is difficult to arrange a day and travelled so far when you are a working person.

0,DESUN Hospital And Heart Institute,Kolkata,This is an incident in the month of February 2019. First of all the doctors are pretty pathetic and will try to extract as much as money as possible from the patient by getting them emotionally weak or rather blackmailing them. So if you want to burn a hole in your pocket and get your patient deteriorated this is the best possible option.They will also get tons of tests done (which has very less significance with respect to the proper diagnosis required ) just to extract money. You dont even get a D of Diagnosis.My grandma went in in a condition and went out much worse than what she was before. Overall this is a much hyped place and the name drives it.
